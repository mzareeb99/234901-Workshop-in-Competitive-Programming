In this question, I used segments,
segments are left and right (x,y) coordinates.
sort old_list by the x-value of the left part of the segment.
for each segment in the list:
	In case of no overlap with the current: add a segment to the list.
	there are 4 types of overlapping:
		1: out on right and out on left
		2: out on right and in on left
		3: in on right and out on left
		4: in on right and in on left

	added_area += area of current.
	output result: added_area / new_building_area.
	list = new list.
for each new building, we go over all current segments.

Complexity Time:
the average complexity is O(N^3).
