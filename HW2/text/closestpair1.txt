Firstly we sort all the points according to the X value,
and then we initialize set (which is sorted by Y value).
the sorted points while saving the min distance.
For each point, we check all the points in the set by and removing points that are far from the current point, according to 
if(current_point.x - point_in_set.x >= min_dist)
	then remove point_in_set from the set
The set is sorted by Y, we can easily find the close points to the current point by using lower_bound and upper_bound, we check if the distance between each of them is less than min_dist and update min_dist accordingly.
We insert the current point into the set and move on to the next point.

Time Complexity:
O(n*log(n)).
