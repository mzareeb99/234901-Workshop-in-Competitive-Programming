Solution without parentheses:
1. Identify all numbers and operators.
2. Go over the input, evaluate only multiplications and divisions (precedence is left to right) and replace them with the results.
3. Go over the input again, evaluate additions and subtractions (precedence is left to right).
Solution with parentheses:
Switch stage 1 with:
1. Identify all numbers and operators. If spotted parentheses in the middle - evaluate them recursively.

Time complexity - O(length of input)
