I solve this question used a ternary search,
In each step of the ternary search, I call to function to check who is the minimum of the vector of the double pairs is less than a number.
the vector contains pairs of the doubles, 
first value = (1/(speed(r) - 1/speed(k))
second value = the total distance / speed(k)
