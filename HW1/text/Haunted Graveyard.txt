I solve this problem by use Bellman Ford.
each cell in the graveyard is a vertex, and every possible transition
from one to another is like an edge.
Number of vertexes <= 30 * 30 = 900
Number of edges <= 4 * 900 + 900 = 4500
Time complexity:
Building the graph - O(V + E)
Running Bellman Ford - O(V * E)
Total - O(V * E)
