I used union-find to union all rhyming words in the same group.
firstly I created a union-find with the size of 200000 because we are given n statements and each statement has 2 words (I can use also 2*n but I decided to take the maximum number).
I also used unordeered_map string->int, and also a vector,
to save each suffix backward for all the words if 2 words have a common root we add them to the same union.
and then we check the op if it is "is" we add them to the same union 
if it is not we add them to a vector.
after we get all the input we check all vector of not words if 2 words are in the same union there is a contradiction else all rhyme.
Complexity:O(nlog*(n))
