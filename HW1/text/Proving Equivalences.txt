the problem is similar to make SCC with minimum add edges.
in the beginning  calculate the SCC graph by running the
SCC algorithm to eliminate unnecessary edges.(Note: Strongly connected
components don't give us any information so we can change them with
one vertex for each component, just like the SCC algorithm does).
Time complexity:
Calculating SCC graph - O(n + m)
Calculating number of vertexes with zero in-degree - O(n + m)
Calculating number of vertexes with zero out-degree - O(n)
Total - O(n + m)
